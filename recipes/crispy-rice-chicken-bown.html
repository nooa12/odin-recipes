    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with parchment. </li>
        <li>Combine chicken, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning, paprika, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Stir until well coated; set aside.  </li>

Add water to the skillet and continue to stir until bottom of skillet is deglazed. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>To serve, divide chicken, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, banana peppers, parsley, and olives among 4 bowls. Top evenly with crispy rice and feta cheese and drizzle with dressing.  </li>
